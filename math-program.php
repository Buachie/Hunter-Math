            <p>
                The mathematics major introduces students to the fundamental areas of mathematics and provides some
                degree
                of
                specialization in one or more areas. It trains students in the analytic thinking characteristic of pure
                and
                applied
                mathematics and provides familiarity with rigorous methods of mathematical proof. In addition to the
                standard
                Mathematics Major, the department offers a number of specialized undergraduate tracks for students
                interested in
                pursuing careers in bioinformatics or in preparing for teaching: the concentration Quantitative
                Biology,
                the
                concentration Preparation for Adolescent Education (Grades 7-12), and the concentration Preparation for
                Childhood
                Education (Grades 1-6) .

                Undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing mathematics at the advanced graduate level are
                urged
                to
                participate in the BA/MA program in Mathematics. For undergraduate students interested in pursuing
                graduate
                work in
                teaching mathematics, the BA/MA program in Preparation for Adolescent Education leads to initial
                certification in
                Adolescent Education (Grades 7-12) in Mathematics. Certification may also be received by completing the
                BA
                degree with
                a mathematics major and then completing the MA in adolescent education in mathematics (see the GRADUATE
                page).
            </p>

            <h2>Mathematics Major Curriculum</h2>
            <p>To enter the standard Mathematics Major, the student should have completed one year of calculus (MATH
                150
                and 155,
                or the equivalent). The major consists of at least 33 credits of coursework: 24 credits of core
                curriculum
                courses
                (taken by all majors except those enrolled in the concentration Preparation for Childhood Education:
                Grades
                1-6)
                and at least 9 credits of advanced elective courses, chosen by students according to their career
                plans.
                Proficiency in symbolic computation is also required.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <h3>Major Core Curriculum</h3>
                <p>(24 cr) MATH 156, 250, 254, 255, 260, 311, 351, and STAT 213 or 311.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Elective Courses</h3>
            <p>
                The student must complete three 3-credit approved elective courses. The elective courses must be chosen
                from the 300-or
                400-level courses in mathematics or statistics listed by the department. Factors affecting the choice
                of courses will
                include the student’s career goals (preparation for graduate study; education; careers in business,
                government service
                or industry), the student’s other major, where applicable, and the availability of courses due to the
                course rotation
                schedule. A 300-level course may be replaced by a graduate level course approved by a departmental
                advisor.
            </p>

            <h3>Symbolic Computation Proficiency Requirement </h3>
            <p>
                As a requirement for graduation with a BA in Mathematics, students must demonstrate entry level
                proficiency in
                symbolic computation. The requirement can be met in any of the following ways:
                a) passing any of MATH 126, MATH 151, MATH 154, MATH 385;
                b) passing a departmental exam in a computer algebra system (currently we use MATHEMATICA or the
                equivalent).

            <h2>Mathematics Minor</h2>
            <div class="note">
                <p>
                    As of March 2009, the selection of a minor is optional at Hunter College. The determination of
                    courses required in a
                    minor concentration is left to the minor departments or programs which choose to offer such
                    sequences.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>A minor in mathematics consists of a minimum of 12 credits selected from any of the following courses
                offered by the
                department: MATH courses numbered 150 or above (with the exception of MATH 261W), STAT 311, STAT 312.
                Students
                should consult the catalog to determine prerequisites necessary for them to enroll in courses that
                count toward the
                minor. It is recommended that prospective mathematics minors consult with an undergraduate mathematics
                advisor
                concerning course selection.

            <h2>Logic Minor</h2>
            <p>
                The minor in logic consists of courses from three distinct disciplines that study logic: mathematics,
                computer science,
                and philosophy. It introduces students to all three disciplinary perspectives on logic. The following
                four cross-listed
                courses are required for this minor: MATH/CSCI/PHILO 275; MATH 370/CSCI 371/PHILO 375; MATH/CSCI/PHILO
                372;
