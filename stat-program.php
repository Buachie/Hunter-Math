            <p>
                The study of statistics provides the student with analytical tools that may find application in various
                fields within
                the sciences and social sciences. Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing area open to students in
                statistics with a
                working knowledge of computing and biological sciences. Actuarial science is one area open to students
                in statistics
                who also have backgrounds in such subjects as computer science, mathematics and economics. The BA/MA in
                Statistics and
                Applied Mathematics offered by the department provides enrichment for undergraduate statistics majors.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enter the Statistics Major the student must have completed MATH 150 and 155. Normally, the
                statistics major consists
                of 33 credits as follows: 30 credits of core curriculum courses and any additional 3-credit statistics,
                mathematics, or
                computer science course approved by the statistics advisor. Modifications are permitted with the
                consent of the
                statistics advisor. For example, a student may elect to replace STAT 212 with a more advanced course.
                With permission
                of the advisor, a student may take graduate courses in statistics and applied mathematics. Students
                interested in
                bioinformatics take the additional courses listed in the concentration in quantitative biology below.

            <h3>Statistics Major With a Concentration in Quantitative Biology</h3>
            <p>
                This program is for students intending to pursue research careers in biomedical sciences. It provides
                students with a
                working knowledge of computing and biological sciences for bioengineering careers in bioinformatics,
                the pharmaceutical
                industry, and the biotechnology industry. For this concentration, students must complete the entry
                requirement for the
                statistics major, MATH 150 and MATH 155, and the core curriculm for the statistics major. Instead of
                taking the
                additional 3cr. major elective course, bioinformatics concentrators take the additional courses listed
                below.

            <h3>Statistics Minor</h3>
            <div class="note">
                <p>
                    As of March 2009, the selection of a minor is optional at Hunter College. The determination of
                    courses required in a
                    minor concentration is left to the minor departments or programs which choose to offer such
                    sequences.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                A minor in statistics consists of at least 12 credits selected from STAT courses offered by the
                department. Students
                should consult the catalog to determine prerequisites necessary for them to enroll in courses that
                count toward the
                minor. It is recommended that prospective statistics minors consult with an undergraduate statistics
                advisor concerning
                course selection.
            </p>

            <h3>Actuarial Sequence</h3>
            <p>
                A student interested in actuarial work should take MATH 150, 155, 250, 260, STAT 311 and 313. Students
                are also
                encouraged to take courses in accounting, economics and computer science. For information concerning
                examinations and
                prizes given to undergraduates by the Society of Actuaries, consult the departmental advisor.
